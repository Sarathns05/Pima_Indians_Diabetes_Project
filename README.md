-----------------------------------------------------------------


Dataset Details
------------

   * Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
   * Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
   * BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
   * SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
   * Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
   * BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)Â²)
   * DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
   * Age: Age (years)



Data Source
--------------
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database.


Technology and tools used
-------------------------

* Python
* Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
* Sklearn for model building
* Google colab as IDE
* Python flask for http server
* HTML/CSS for UI
* Heroku for deployement



Overview
----------

STEP 1: Data Preparation and model building

In this step, explore the data, do the required pre-processing and try various Machine Learning models

STEP 2: Building the app using Flask and HTML

Here, fetch the best-performing model from step 1 and build a web app using Flask and HTML.

STEP 3: Deploying the app using Heroku

In the end deploy the working app through Heroku for the world to use our product.

## EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) :

Model Deployment
--------------------

* The web application is built using python library -> Flask and Web Programming languages -> HTML, CSS
* The entire application is finally deployed on Heroku by adding - Procfile (informs Heroku that which application is to be run first), Requirements         (notifies Heroku about the libraries that needs to be installed before deploying or running our application)
* See the deployed application [here](https://diabetesfinder.herokuapp.com/).
